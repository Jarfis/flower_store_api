ok, so, I'm thinking that for the first pass, they'll have to create an account before they can start a cart, basicly replace all add_to_cart buttons with "create account" or "login"
user logs in:
  we send any orders with a status of "in_progress" to the client and populate the cart from there

user adds something to a cart:
  we send the flower and quantity to server, create orders_flowers entry for current cart



i think for unsigned in users when they start adding items to a cart we store it in a local object and a cookie.
if they sign up, we make an in_progress cart for them from the cookie/local storage cart
if they sign in there might be a conflict between the local cart and an already in progress one
  I'm thinking we send the app the already in progress cart and offer the user options
  pick a cart to overwrite
  merge carts

lets go through a users workflow

navigate to site:
  they'll see the landing page, a button to browse, a button to search, a button to sign in, a button to sign up

they click browse:
  load index of flowers
  they click flower:
    navigate to page for that flower
    they see add to cart button
    click add to cart button:
      if signed in send post to server
      if not signed in start up a local cart object/cookie

they click search:
  navigate to search page:
    they see input for flower name and button to start search
    they enter text and hit search:
      send search field back to server, do query for flowers with names like query, return results

they click sign_in:
  go to sign in page
  submit sign in:
    sign in
    check to see if theres an in progress cart on server
    send it back
    if local also has an in progress cart, prompt user to pick a cart or merge them
    they pick local cart:
      send local cart up to server and replace the in_progress one with it
    they pick server cart:
      replace local cart
    they merge:
      send local cart to server, perform magic to merge

they click cart icon
  get in progress cart
  display contents of cart
  display controls to remove or adjust quantity of flowers in cart
  display purchase button
  click plus/minus for flowers
    send post to orders_flowers update
  click remove for flowers
    send delete to orders_flowers
  click purchase
    send get tp orders#purchase
    redirect to purchase page
      show cart deets again
      show payment method select (list existing cards as well as form for new cards)
      make new card:
        enter details
        post to stripe
        get stripe user and stripe card
        send to users#addCard (stripe_user, stripe_card)
      they pick a payment method
        redirect to shipping address page
        get index of users contacts
        show button/form to add new contact
        show "next" button
        click next button
          go to confirm page
          can choose to go back to a step
          can confirm
          confirms
            send post to server with all the payment and shipping jazz

also, add a drop down for signed in users to let them change settings, add contacts, add cards, view purchase history
